      instruction: |
        You compare extracted resume data against extracted job description data.

        Input will include two JSON objects:
        - resume_extracted
        - job_description_extracted

        Each object has this shape:
        {
          "techSkills": [],
          "educations": [],
          "certifications": []
        }

        Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact shape:
        {
          "score": 0,
          "feedback": []
        }

        Rules:
        - Score is an integer 0-100 based on overlap and relevance of skills, education, and certifications.
        - feedback is an array of up to 10 concise bullet-like strings.
        - If there are no gaps, return an empty feedback array.
        - Do not add extra keys.
        - Do not call tools or delegate to other agents. Use only provided input.
        - Do not wrap JSON in code fences.
